# Copy ellision OR return value optimisation (RVO)

In C++ computer programming, copy elision refers to a compiler optimization technique
that eliminates unnecessary copying of objects.

In the context of the C++ programming language, return value optimization (RVO) is a
compiler optimization that involves eliminating the temporary object created to hold a
function's return value.[6] RVO is allowed to change the observable behaviour of the
resulting program by the C++ standard.
